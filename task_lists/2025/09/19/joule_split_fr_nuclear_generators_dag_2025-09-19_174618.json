Operation: For each selected source object, create two destination objects representing North and South. Naming rule: derive a base from the source object name by taking its first 3 characters (if longer than 3) and append 'N' for North and 'S' for South, producing names of length \u2264 4. Enforce uniqueness within the Generator class; if a collision occurs, resolve deterministically while maintaining a maximum of 4 characters and preserving the 'N'/'S' suffix. Preserve existing properties, attributes, and memberships from the source to both destinations.",
