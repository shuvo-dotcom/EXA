Add 2 new Gas Fields 1 called 'e-kerosene import' and the other 'e-methanol import'. Perform a web search/LLM call to find import terminals for kerosene and methanol into Europe by ship and yearly capacity including any information on seasonal capacities. Ensure we have the city name so we can link them to the hydrogen nodes by locating and reading the NUTS regions e-highway file in the nodes and lines folder. Create pipelines to link the kerosene import nodes to the relevant hydrogen node. Make the capacity of the pipelines match the import terminal capacities.",
