Ensure the workbook conforms to TYNDP 2026 formatting and includes all required sheets and metadata.\n\nExpected Outputs: hydrogen_tst_workbook.xlsx\n\nInput Requirements: hydrogen demand data (annual total or existing profile), carrier identifier set to \"hydrogen\"\n\nAdditional Notes: Emil should verify that the demand data aligns with the TYNDP 2026 scenario assumptions before exporting.",
