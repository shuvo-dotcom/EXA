2,2.2,2.2.1,EU,"The modelling approach for the EU energy system is executed in a two‑stage optimisation framework. In the first stage, an expansion model determines the optimal capacity additions across electricity, hydrogen and transport infrastructures. Candidate technologies for electricity generation include utility‑scale solar PV, offshore wind (both fixed‑bottom and floating), onshore wind, small modular nuclear reactors (SMR) and battery storage at both utility and building levels. For hydrogen, the model can invest in methane pyrolysis or water electrolysers, as well as hydrogen storage facilities. It also decides on the construction of synthetic fuel production plants for kerosene and methanol, which are sized according to downstream hydrogen availability and captured CO₂ volumes. Electricity transmission assets are selected from the TYNDP scenarios, while hydrogen transport options comprise refurbishing existing methane pipelines or building new dedicated hydrogen pipelines; if a methane line is refurbished for hydrogen, its capacity is removed from the methane transport pool.  

The second stage is a dispatch model that uses the capacity portfolio from the expansion step as input to simulate hourly operation. This includes detailed representation of demand sectors, residential, tertiary, industry and transport, for each energy carrier. Each sector is linked to its respective market via a wheeling cost that captures taxes and congestion charges, guiding the model’s choice between utility‑scale and prosumer‑level investments. Electric vehicle fleets are modelled with vehicle‑to‑grid capabilities, allowing them to provide flexibility services.  

Because storage investments are often under‑represented in the expansion results, a post‑processing adjustment is applied to reinforce storage capacity where needed to ensure system adequacy. The combined two‑step process thus yields a cost‑optimal, sector‑coupled description of the EU’s future energy infrastructure, reflecting technology options, sectoral demand, and the interplay between electricity and hydrogen networks.",Modelling Methodologies,Modelling Approach,Modelling Approach,
2,2.1,2.1.1,EU,"The high‑level architecture of the EU modelling framework is built around a unified spatial topology defined at the NUTS‑2 level, which partitions the Union into regions of comparable size and socio‑economic relevance. This common grid underpins all energy carriers, electricity (including offshore hubs), hydrogen, and electric vehicles, ensuring consistent inter‑regional linkages and facilitating integrated scenario analysis.

Data ingestion begins with the latest transmission system data for each carrier. Electricity network topology and parameters are sourced from ENTSO‑E, hydrogen pipelines from ENTSOG, and complementary grid attributes from the SCI‑grid repository. These datasets are harmonised onto the NUTS‑2 mesh, creating carrier‑specific base grids that share node identifiers and adjacency structures.

Offshore electricity infrastructure is modelled by attaching additional nodes to the coastal NUTS‑2 regions of each member state. While not every country activates offshore zones in a given scenario, the offshore node set remains in the model to allow investment decisions and capacity expansion analysis. Offshore hubs are linked to the on‑shore grid through dedicated interconnectors, with capacity limits derived from current offshore wind connection data where available.

Hydrogen distribution follows the same NUTS‑2 topology, with pipelines mapped onto the existing electricity grid where co‑location is feasible. The model incorporates conversion facilities (electrolysers, power‑to‑gas units) at strategic nodes, enabling cross‑carrier flow of energy.

The electric‑vehicle sector is represented as a demand and flexibility layer attached to the electricity nodes. Vehicle charging demand is allocated to NUTS‑2 regions based on population and vehicle registration statistics, while vehicle‑to‑grid (V2G) capabilities are modelled as distributed storage at the same nodes.

Overall, the architecture provides a coherent, regionally granular platform that integrates multiple carriers, supports offshore investment modelling, and leverages authoritative data sources to reflect the current state of the EU energy system.",Modelling Methodologies,Modelling Methodologies,Modelling Methodologies,
2,2.3,2.3.1,EU,"The model draws its input data for the European Union from a series of established scenario and infrastructure datasets. Baseline generation capacities, storage capacities and commodity price forecasts are taken from the TYNDP 2024 scenarios, which provide a comprehensive view of existing and planned electricity assets across the EU. Grid topology and investment candidates are sourced from the electricity TYNDP 2024, delivering both the current baseline grid configuration and the list of potential network upgrades. Since a hydrogen transmission network does not yet exist, the hydrogen grid is initialized at zero, with investment cost parameters derived from the European Hydrogen Backbone study, which outlines cost assumptions for a pan‑European hydrogen corridor. Information on the natural gas (methane) transmission system is obtained from the Sci‑grid and ENTSOG datasets, supplying network characteristics and cost data for the existing gas grid. Additional investment cost details are supplemented by the Danish Energy Agency’s Technology Catalogue, which provides technology‑specific cost data; where gaps remain, the model calculates missing costs and prices using standard engineering and economic assumptions. Together, these sources furnish a consistent and detailed set of inputs for the EU‑wide modelling exercise.",Modelling Methodologies,Data Sources,Data Sources,
2,2.4,2.4.1,EU,"The electricity system in the EU is modelled as an integrated market that supplies four end‑use sectors: industry, transport, residential and tertiary. The reference grid serves as the baseline network, to which additional transmission candidates are added to represent potential expansions. Investment candidates include on‑shore wind, utility‑scale solar PV, offshore wind farms, nuclear small modular reactors (SMRs) for industry, and distributed generation such as rooftop solar with battery storage in residential and tertiary buildings. In the market‑based segment, larger generation plants, both renewable (on‑shore and offshore wind, solar PV) and nuclear, are assumed to be connected directly to the wholesale electricity market. By contrast, sector‑specific investments (e.g., rooftop PV with batteries) are placed within the demand side of the industrial, residential and tertiary sectors. Demand‑side response (DSR) is modelled for the tertiary and industrial sectors, reflecting flexible consumption that can be shifted in response to market signals.

Grid expansion follows a candidate‑addition approach: the reference transmission topology is supplemented with optional lines and offshore hubs. Offshore zones are delineated along the European seas, each evaluated for its capacity to host wind farms and other offshore renewables. Offshore hubs act as collection points, aggregating power from multiple wind farms before transmitting it ashore via high‑capacity links. Investment cost modelling distinguishes capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operational expenditure (OPEX) for offshore wind farms, hub infrastructure, and associated transmission. Economic efficiency analyses identify the least‑cost transmission routes and hub locations for integrating offshore generation into the on‑shore grid.

Battery storage is introduced as an explicit investment candidate. Utility‑scale batteries are allocated in the market segment, while prosumer‑level batteries are post‑processed based on the installed rooftop PV capacity to reflect higher penetration in residential and tertiary sectors. The deployment of residential and tertiary batteries is driven not only by technology cost and discount rates but also by macro‑economic factors such as GDP, subsidy levels, and the financial sophistication of end‑users. This multi‑criteria approach captures the observed tendency for higher battery adoption in wealthier regions and where policy incentives are stronger.

The model does not enforce the European Commission’s 2050 target of 300 GW offshore capacity; instead, offshore build‑out emerges from the optimisation based on cost and grid integration constraints. Consequently, the resulting offshore capacity reflects the most cost‑effective configuration given the candidate set, rather than a predetermined target.

Overall, the sectoral methodology for electricity in the EU combines a market‑centric representation of large‑scale generation with detailed, sector‑specific investment options, a candidate‑based grid expansion framework, and a nuanced treatment of battery storage that incorporates both economic and socio‑economic drivers.",Modelling Methodologies,Sectoral Methodologies,Electricity,
2,2.4,2.4.2,EU,"The European Union is actively engaged in a comprehensive planning process for hydrogen development, envisioning a pivotal role for this energy carrier in its decarbonization strategy. This includes the conceptualization and initial stages of the European Hydrogen Backbone (EHB), a dedicated infrastructure for hydrogen transport across the continent. The costing data for this backbone is drawn from the European Hydrogen Backbone report, informing the capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operational expenditure (OPEX) calculations in the investment stage model, where pipeline lengths directly determine these costs. The model features 110 nodes, representing key locations within this potential network, and allows for investments in various supply sources: Electrolysers for green hydrogen, Steam Methane Reformers, Methane Pyrolysis, and Ammonia Regasification Terminals.

Investment decisions within the model are initially unconstrained by geography, allowing for allocation across Europe. These decisions are influenced by a 'willingness to pay' (WTB) factor, which economically reflects the cost of fuel supply disruptions. A higher WTB prioritizes regions with the most advantageous renewable potential and competitive Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE), such as southern Europe for solar and coastal or windy regions for wind power, thereby steering green hydrogen production towards optimal locations.

The regulatory framework significantly shapes the hydrogen sector. The Renewable Energy Directive III (RED III), adopted in 2023, is central to this, raising the EU-wide renewable energy target to at least 42.5% by 2030 (with an aspirational 45%). A core component of RED III is the establishment of a dedicated framework for Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBOs), defined as liquid or gaseous fuels derived from renewable electricity, excluding biomass, which must achieve a minimum 70% greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction compared to fossil equivalents (e.g., 94 gCO₂eq/MJ). For hydrogen, this translates to a life-cycle GHG emissions savings threshold of approximately 3.4 kgCO₂eq/kgH₂.

RED III sets binding quantitative targets for RFNBOs across key sectors. In industry, 42% of hydrogen consumed must be RFNBOs by 2030, escalating to 60% by 2035. Member States have some flexibility to reduce these targets by up to 20% under specific conditions related to their national contributions to the overall EU target and fossil hydrogen consumption. For the transport sector, RFNBOs must constitute at least 1% of total energy consumption by 2030, contributing to a broader combined sub-target of 5.5% for advanced biofuels and RFNBOs. To incentivize their uptake, RFNBOs receive multipliers towards these targets: 1.5 times for aviation and maritime sectors, and 2 times for all other transport modes. This is further reinforced by the ReFuelEU Aviation Mandate, which sets progressive blending requirements for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) at EU airports, including a specific sub-target for synthetic aviation fuels (e-SAF), which are RFNBOs, rising to 1.2% by 2030 and 35% by 2050. The model incorporates these demand drivers, as transport demand covers aviation, maritime, and heavy-duty vehicles.

The sustainability of RFNBO production is ensured through strict criteria, outlined in delegated acts complementing RED III. The electricity used for RFNBO production must be considered ""fully renewable,"" meeting ""additionality"" requirements (coming from new, unsubsidized renewable capacity, generally from 2028 onwards, with transitional exceptions) and ""temporal-geographic correlation"" (matching generation with consumption in time and location). The second delegated act provides a methodology for calculating the full life-cycle GHG emissions of RFNBOs, ensuring transparent verification.

The scale of the EU's hydrogen ambition is reflected in significant infrastructure investment plans. The European Hydrogen Backbone is projected to require a total investment ranging from €80 billion to €143 billion, with annual operating costs estimated between €1.6 billion and €3.2 billion. Several Member States are contributing to this vision. For example, Spain’s total estimated gross investment for hydrogen infrastructure, including the H2Med pipeline and underground storage, is approximately €4.9 billion (€3.7 billion for H2Med, €1.2 billion for storage), with Enagás planning to invest €3.125 billion specifically in renewable hydrogen infrastructure by 2030. Spain has also secured €1.22 billion in aid for seven large hydrogen valleys/clusters, totaling 2,292 MW of electrolysis power. Austria targets 1 GW of electrolysis capacity by 2030, while Portugal aims for 2-2.5 GW. Bulgaria supports pilot projects yielding 55 MW of green hydrogen between 2022 and 2026 and targets hydrogen usage of 1,000 tonnes of oil equivalent by 2030, increasing to 9,000 toe by 2040. These national initiatives collectively underscore the extensive investment and capacity build-out required to meet the EU's hydrogen and RFNBO targets.

2,2.4,2.4.3,EU,"The methane sector in the EU comprises four principal end‑use categories: the market (industrial and commercial supply), residential heating, tertiary industry activities, and transport. The current system is largely fueled by biomethane, while a proportion of the gas entering the EU network originates from non‑EU sources that still contain conventional natural gas. Biomethane serves three main functions within the EU energy mix: it meets direct final‑energy demand for heating and process uses, it can be combusted for electricity generation, and it acts as a feedstock for steam methane reformers that produce hydrogen for downstream applications. The existing gas transmission and distribution infrastructure is capable of being retrofitted to transport hydrogen. If such a conversion were undertaken, the grid would cease to carry methane, restricting biomethane supply to localized distribution networks rather than the wider transmission system. Consequently, a hydrogen‑focused retrofit would fundamentally reshape the role of the methane grid, confining biomethane to regional or onsite applications while eliminating its presence in the broader transport network.",Modelling Methodologies,Sectoral Methodologies,Methane,
2,2.4,2.4.4,EU,"The modelling of the Electric Vehicles (EV) sector within the European Union (EU) adopts a comprehensive approach to understand charging demand, infrastructure utilisation, and grid impacts. Passenger cars are a primary focus, modelled in two principal configurations: vehicles predominantly utilising Home Charging and those relying on Street Charging. This distinction is crucial for assessing diverse charging behaviours and infrastructure demands.

Driving demand is quantified in kilometers driven. A granular approach is applied, disaggregating driving habits based on age demographics (child, teen, adult, senior) and a range of daily activities including School Run, Evening Activities, Daily Activities, Part Time Workers, Remote Workers, Evening Leisure, Night Life, Full Time Workers, and Taxi services. Each geographical node within the model incorporates bespoke driving profiles derived from the age split of its population, leveraging data from Eurostat. Car ownership rates, estimated per demographic group, are integrated as a weighting dimension to accurately scale demand.

Charging infrastructure is categorised into Home Chargers, Street Chargers, and Work Chargers. Home chargers are typically connected to residential nodes, with a modelled capacity of 7kV, representing a common range between 3.3kV and 11kV. Tertiary and street chargers are rated at 22kV. Access points are defined such that vehicles configured for Home Charging connect exclusively to home chargers, while Street Charging vehicles access both street and work chargers. Charger availability is a critical factor, incorporating demographic groups such as Full time workers, part time workers, remote workers, university students, unemployed, and senior citizens, to determine when vehicles have access to charging facilities throughout the day.

Specific rules govern charger access and sharing. For car owners utilising street chargers, a sharing ratio of one street charging station for every 20 vehicles is applied. In office environments, a ratio of one charging station per 40 vehicles is considered, with full-time and part-time workers having access to work chargers from 08:00 to 20:00. General access permits vehicle owners to connect to their respective chargers when not engaged in work, educational pursuits, or other activities away from home. In terms of capacity, it is assumed that work chargers can accommodate 25% of the maximum number of EVs that could connect, street chargers can accommodate 50%, and home chargers are assumed to be sufficient for 100% of electric vehicles configured for home charging.

The modelling framework integrates both baseline and projection data. Baseline data encompasses the current number of EVs, their existing usage patterns, and the present charging infrastructure landscape. Projection data incorporates estimations for future EV adoption growth, anticipated advancements in battery technology, and the projected expansion of charging networks. The analysis further considers distinct charging behaviours, including Residential Charging (typically during evening and night hours), Public Charging (which varies based on availability and user behaviour), and Fast Charging, assessing its impact on quick top-ups and peak demand periods. The overall grid impact of EV charging, including contributions to peak loads and potential needs for grid reinforcements, is assessed. Advanced considerations include the potential for Demand Response strategies, where EV charging can be adjusted based on grid conditions and electricity prices, and the modelling of Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technologies, where EVs could feed electricity back into the grid during high-demand periods.",Modelling Methodologies,Sectoral Methodologies,Electric Vehicles,
