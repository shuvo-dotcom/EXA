1,1.4,1.4.1,EU,"The hydrogen sector within the European Union is currently in a foundational planning phase, with its existing infrastructure primarily comprising Steam Methane Reformers (SMRs) and associated local distribution networks. These SMR facilities, which currently produce hydrogen, are slated for a complete phase-out by 2050, necessitating the development and construction of new hydrogen production infrastructure. The EU is actively engaged in a comprehensive planning process to develop its hydrogen ecosystem, recognizing its strategic importance in the future energy landscape. 

Hydrogen's role is rapidly expanding across multiple sectors. Industrially, it is becoming increasingly critical for applications in refineries, steel production, and the manufacturing of ammonia and methanol. The stable and consistent supply required by these industrial processes is anticipated to be secured through long-term contracts or dedicated electricity provisions. Beyond industrial uses, hydrogen is projected to play a significant role in replacing CO2-emitting primary energy sources in electricity generation, transport, and the production of synthetic fuels, thereby serving as a key component in the future energy mix.

The future hydrogen system is envisioned to integrate several core components: electrolysers for producing hydrogen from water, dedicated hydrogen storage facilities, and dedicated renewable energy sources to power the electrolysis process. The topological design of the hydrogen system is being modelled to mirror that of the electricity system, requiring a nodal alignment to efficiently determine and manage electrolytic supply. Looking towards 2050, the potential for techno-economically viable extraction of white hydrogen from geological sources, for instance in countries like France, is also under consideration, contingent on the development of appropriate extraction methods.

To drive this transition, the EU has established ambitious targets and launched significant initiatives. Notably, the European Commission has approved a €998 million scheme to support renewable hydrogen production in the Netherlands, targeting at least 200MW of electrolysis capacity by 2024, expanding to 500MW by 2025, and an overarching goal of 3-4GW by 2030. Concurrently, the EU has sanctioned €1.4 billion in subsidies for various hydrogen projects across the bloc, designed to advance clean energy technologies. Overall, the EU's Hydrogen Strategy outlines ambitious production targets of 6GW of electrolysis capacity by 2024, yielding up to 1 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen, and a substantial increase to 40GW capacity producing 10 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen by 2030. Additionally, the EU aims to import 10 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen annually by 2030 to meet anticipated demand. While concerns regarding the feasibility of these 2030 targets have been expressed, the European Commission remains committed to achieving them.",Executive Summary,Sectors Modelled,Hydrogen,
1,1.4,1.4.2,EU,"The electricity sector in the European Union is undergoing rapid transformation, driven by decarbonisation, sector coupling and the integration of variable renewable energy sources. By the first half of 2024 wind and solar together supplied 30 % of the EU’s electricity, overtaking fossil‑fuel generation which fell to 27 %. This shift reflects accelerated deployment of renewable capacity and the impact of recent market reforms aimed at stabilising prices and encouraging low‑carbon generation. Decarbonising power generation is a core requirement for the EU’s 2050 carbon‑neutral target; projections indicate that by 2050 electricity generation will be almost entirely free of carbon emissions, with the majority of output coming from wind, solar and other variable renewables. The sector also supports indirect electrification pathways, providing electricity for hydrogen production and synthetic fuels, thereby linking power generation to broader energy demand. To balance the increasing share of intermittent renewables, the EU will need additional flexibility resources, including battery storage, demand‑side response and expanded grid infrastructure. The coupling of electricity with other sectors, notably transport and industry, is accelerating demand, reinforcing the need for a resilient, low‑carbon electricity system that can meet both direct and indirect electrification needs while maintaining system stability.",Executive Summary,Sectors Modelled,Electricity,
1,1.4,1.4.3,EU,"The EU methane sector is emerging as a pivotal element of the energy transition, bridging the decline of coal, lignite and oil with the expansion of renewables and hydrogen. As conventional fossil‑fuel extraction is scheduled to cease by 2050, natural gas will no longer serve as a primary source of methane, prompting a shift toward biomethane and other low‑carbon gas alternatives. This transition is quantified by the EU’s commitment to cut methane emissions by 30 % by 2030 relative to 2020 levels, a target embedded in the 2024 regulation that mandates measurement‑based monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) and leak detection and repair (LDAR) for oil, gas and coal operations. The regulation, effective July 2024, also extends to imported fossil fuels, requiring compliance by 2027 and leveraging satellite monitoring for “super‑emitting” events.  

Cross‑sectoral impacts are evident across electricity, heating and hydrogen production. During periods of prolonged low wind and solar output – the so‑called dunkelflaute, typically lasting up to two weeks – methane‑derived electricity and hydrogen provide critical backup, sustaining supply security. Biomethane, produced from waste and agricultural residues, is projected to see a pronounced uptake as the EU decarbonises its gas system, reinforcing the role of gas infrastructure while reducing net emissions.  

The regulatory framework enhances transparency and accountability, driving technological innovation in emissions detection and contributing to broader climate objectives under the European Green Deal and REPowerEU plan. By tightening standards for both domestic and imported methane sources, the EU aims to improve air quality, public health and economic resilience, while positioning itself as a leader in global methane reduction efforts, exemplified by its role in the Global Methane Pledge which targets a 30 % cut by 2030 across more than 100 participating countries.",Executive Summary,Sectors Modelled,Methane,
1,1.4,1.4.4,EU,"The Offshore Hubs sector in the European Union is characterised by a nascent but rapidly expanding offshore electricity network that is intended to serve as a backbone for trans‑European power distribution.  The European Commission’s offshore strategy outlines a voluntary 300 GW capacity ambition for the region, while member‑state commitments target 111 GW of offshore renewable generation by 2030 and between 281 GW and 354 GW by 2050.  These figures provide a quantitative benchmark against which the current and planned offshore hub infrastructure can be assessed.

The Offshore Network Development Plan (ONDP), produced by ENTSO‑E as part of the Ten‑Year Network Development Plan, translates the non‑binding agreements of January 2023 into concrete transmission equipment requirements and cost estimates.  The ONDP emphasizes integrated on‑shore/off‑shore planning, cross‑border cost‑sharing, and the deployment of high‑voltage direct‑current (HVDC) links.  It also highlights the need for coordinated investment in port facilities – estimated at €6.5 billion by 2030 – to support the assembly, installation, and maintenance of offshore wind farms.

Technological innovation is a key driver: floating offshore wind is projected to reach 7 GW by 2030, extending development into deeper waters where fixed foundations are not feasible.  HVDC technology underpins the envisioned hub architecture, enabling efficient long‑distance power transfer and facilitating hybrid projects that combine generation and transmission assets across multiple jurisdictions.

Market‑design elements underpin the sector’s economic potential.  Integrated planning mechanisms aim to align offshore hub development with environmental objectives and resource optimisation.  Cross‑border coordination is codified in the revised TEN‑E Regulation, which provides a framework for shared financing and operational responsibilities.  Investment stability is reinforced through revenue‑stabilisation tools such as Contracts for Difference, which are expected to lower financing costs and attract private capital.

Overall, the offshore hubs sector is moving from a limited set of radial connections toward a more interconnected, high‑capacity grid that could distribute up to several hundred gigawatts of renewable power across the EU.  The alignment of capacity targets, infrastructure investment, and regulatory mechanisms suggests a substantial economic upside, provided the planned transmission assets and supporting ports are realised on schedule.",Executive Summary,Sectors Modelled,Offshore Hubs,
1,1.4,1.4.5,EU,"The electric vehicles (EVs) sector in the EU presents a complex dynamic within the electricity system, characterized by both significant load creation at the distribution level and the future potential for system balancing. Modelling of this sector primarily focuses on passenger electric vehicles, considering their unique operational patterns compared to other transport types like trucks and buses, which are anticipated to create a more predictable load. Passenger EVs are modelled considering diverse charging behaviors, including home charging, street charging, and office charging. A granular approach is taken to demand profiles, dissecting urban areas based on demographics and vehicle usage patterns, encompassing activities such as working from home, automated car sharing services, school runs, and evening activities.

Current market trends in the EU indicate a notable shift towards electrification. As of June 2024, battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) constituted 14.4% of the EU car market, reflecting a steady increase in adoption. Hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs) have also seen substantial growth, reaching 29.5% of the market share, while plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) experienced a decline to 6.1%. This growing penetration is supported by an expanding charging infrastructure, with new legislation mandating the installation of fast-recharging stations every 60 kilometers along major highways by 2025 across the EU.

Technological advancements have further bolstered the attractiveness of EVs. The year 2024 witnessed improvements in battery efficiency and the introduction of a wider variety of vehicle models, including SUVs and city cars, catering to diverse consumer preferences. These developments are contributing to a broader shift in consumer preferences towards electric vehicles, driven by increasing public awareness and product availability. Regionally, adoption rates vary, with Northern and Western European countries such as Norway, the Netherlands, Germany, and France leading in EV uptake. Southern and Eastern European regions, including Catalonia in Spain and Lombardy in Italy, are progressively improving their adoption levels. The ongoing investment in charging infrastructure and continuous technological innovation in battery technology and vehicle design are essential factors underpinning the sector's evolution, enhancing both the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of electric mobility within the EU.",Executive Summary,Sectors Modelled,Electric Vehicles,
