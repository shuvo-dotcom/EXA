4,4.1,4.1.1,EU,"Chapter 4.1.1 presents the results of the two‑stage modelling approach applied to the European Union energy system. The expansion model first determines the optimal capacity additions across a range of electricity supply technologies – solar PV, on‑shore and offshore wind (both fixed‑bottom and floating), concentrated solar power with thermal storage, and nuclear small modular reactors – as well as investments in electricity and hydrogen transmission corridors and storage facilities. The subsequent hourly dispatch model evaluates how the chosen portfolio can be operated at minimum system cost while meeting demand and respecting technical constraints. The optimisation reveals a pronounced shift toward variable renewable generation, with the model selecting substantial capacities of offshore wind and solar PV to satisfy the bulk of electricity demand, complemented by targeted nuclear SMR capacity to provide firm low‑carbon baseload. Hydrogen infrastructure is expanded primarily to support sector coupling, with dedicated pipelines and underground storage allocated in regions with high renewable generation. The combined solution reduces total system cost relative to a baseline scenario by a significant margin, driven by lower capital expenditures on fossil‑fuel generation and reduced fuel consumption. Hourly dispatch results show high utilisation of renewable assets during periods of abundant generation, while storage and hydrogen conversion assets smooth variability and ensure reliability across the year.",Modelling Results,Modelling Results,Modelling Results,
