    title: "TSO Review Pack — Hourly Demand Profiling Methodology"
    version: "Draft v1"
    date: "2025-09-01"
    purpose: "Explain conversion of ETM annual demands into hourly demand profiles by sector/subsector & carrier."

    Intro:
      copy: |
        This report describes how annual energy demands from the Energy Transition Model (ETM) are converted into country‑specific hourly demand
        profiles across sectors, subsectors, and energy carriers. Its purpose is to provide TSOs with a transparent and reviewable basis for
        energy modelling. Hourly profiles are generated for multiple scenarios (example National Trends, High Economy and Low Economy).

    scope:
      copy: |
        The tool can produce profiles for a variety of energy carriers. Hydrogen entries include direct final uses reported in the ETM, District Heating
        and ammonia feedstock where countries submit that information. Hydrogen used to produce synthetic fuels is excluded from these hourly sectoral 
        profiles and is modelled separately as flat offtake profiles to avoid double counting. Additionally, District heating is considered in the 
        profiles as delivered heat demand and is modelled using temperature‑driven hourly shapes.

    scenarios_framework:
      copy: |
        The methodology supports the NT, NT_HE and NT_LE scenario family across the years 2030, 2035, 2040 and 2050. Hydrogen allocation uses two
        zoning concepts: Zone 1 for local distribution networks and pilots, and Zone 2 for a backbone network and industrial clusters. The
        default geographic resolution is one node per country, with exceptions for countries that require multiple nodes. Representative climate
        years aligned to SSP2‑4.5 are used to drive weather‑sensitive loads and enable weather sensitivity analysis.

    inputs_data_sources:
      copy: |
        The primary inputs are ETM annual values by sector, subsector and carrier; hourly temperature series for multiple representative climate years;
        country district heating submissions; reference industry hourly shapes from public and academic datasets (ELMAS); and transport activity patterns (EUROSTAT).
        Car/bus/freight profiles are based on activity curves calibrated to annual energy and carrier mix, while aviation uses monthly kerosene
        profiles (EUROSTAT).

    methodology_overview:
      copy: |
        The processing steps are: collect ETM annuals, temperature series, reference shapes and zone/climate selections, select a driver model
        for each subsector (e.g. temperature regression for space heating or representative operating shapes for industry), generate a
        base hourly shape for the chosen climate year, normalize and scale that shape to the ETM annual for the sector/subsector/carrier, allocate
        hydrogen between zones per national guidance. Driver models include
        heat‑sensitive regressions, near‑flat domestic hot water profiles with AM/PM peaks, representative industry shapes and activity‑based
        transport disaggregation.

    temperature_regression:
      copy: |
        Heat‑sensitive loads are modelled with linear or piecewise regressions of hourly heat demand versus temperature (for example H_t = HDD.t + c
        below a threshold) calibrated per country across multiple climate years. A chosen climate‑year hourly temperature series is applied to
        generate the subsector hourly shape, which is then scaled to the ETM annual total and adjusted for technology efficiencies where required.
        This approach preserves cold‑snap and shoulder‑season behaviour, ensures comparability across countries and maintains weather sensitivity.

    zones_allocation_h2:
      copy: |
        Hydrogen end‑uses are assigned to Zone 1 or Zone 2 based on national network and backbone plans. Zone 1 covers networks; 
        Zone 2 covers hydrogen hubs and backbone. The hourly H2 profiles for Zone 1 and Zone 2 always sum to the total H2 hourly demand for each sector and subsector.
