  Nuclear Fusion:
    description:  Nuclear fusion assets generate electricity through the fusion of atomic nuclei. Modelling these assets is complex because it requires representing the tritium breeding process. 
                  A typical model setup includes a 'Generator' object and a home 'Node' for the fusion plant itself, typically this node will already exist. It need to connect to a tritium Fuel object (new if doesn't exist).
                  To model the tritium breeding, a 'Power2X' object should be created in a new Tritium breeding 'Node'. The tritium will be created will be created by the 'Power2X' object.
                  A 'Line' connects the fusion plant's node to the tritium breeding node, to represent the nucleus from the fusion process. The tritium produced is represented by a 'Fuel' object, which is then supplied back to the fusion plant's 'Generator'.
